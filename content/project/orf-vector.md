We have developed Orf virus, which is parapox virus, as a vaccine delivery platfrom. We are using well-characterized immunomudolatory loci present in the genome of Orf virus to insert heterologous genes to develop receombinant viruses that can be used as a vaccine. We have already shown high level of protection against PEDV using [recombinant Orf virus expressing Spike gene of PEDV](https://lokfiles.netlify.com/orfv-pedv.pdf). This recombinant virus also protects piglets born to our recombinant virus immunized sows [(Check paper here)](https://lokfiles.netlify.com/pedv-passive-immunity.pdf). Our goal is to develop Orf virus as a vaccine delivery platform for many other infectious disease of swine and other livestock species.
