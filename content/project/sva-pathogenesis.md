Senecavirus A is a re-emergiging disease of swine. It causes vesicular disease in swine. Despite detection of Senecavirus A nucleic acid in pigs with vesicular disease, attemps to establish causal relationship had failed. We were able to reproduce the disease in swine and we have published a detail pathogenesis of Senecavirus A [in this paper](http://lokfiles.netlify.com/sva-pathogenesis.pdf). We are still working to understand other aspects of this disease in swine.
