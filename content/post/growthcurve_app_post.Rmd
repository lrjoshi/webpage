I designed this shiny based app to generate growth curves. This app is based on ggplot and dplyr functions.You can [download the sample data here](https://github.com/lrjoshi/files/blob/master/public/c159s.csv).Codes are available on my [Github](https://github.com/lrjoshi/gcplotR).If the app below is not active, you can click **Reload** button below. You can see the sample output graph below.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://heartsdsu.shinyapps.io/gcshiny/",
                   height = "1600px")

```
