Issue-
Folders public and static were not being selected for deploying.

Solve -
There is a index.lock file in .git folder. This folder is hidden so you have to enable show hidden folder setting.

Then go to the Terminal in R studio and use following command
git add -A

Then all the files and folders will be selected and you can commit and push to the github repository.
