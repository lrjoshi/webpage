      <description>RNA-Seq data analysis can be complicated. Softwares with graphical user interface like CLC Workbench have made RNA-Seq data analysis quite easier but often we don&amp;rsquo;t know how the algorithm is working especially if you are from biology background like me. I decided to run a small simulation to understand how this works.It is amazing how a single R package can do things like read aligning and read counts in a few lines of codes.</description>

      <description>Although seems straightforward, working with SRA files can be tricky for newbies. Here I have short description about how to download and work with SRA files.
NGS read files can be downloaded using sra-toolkit. First you have to download latest version of sra-toolkit from their website. The file should be in tar.gz format.
Then untar the file based on the OS you are using.
Then use the following command to put command line in path</description>
